Final Project-MMC6278

This is a Social Media Quotes Generator.

Our visual generator provides a database of photos and quotes that are automatically formatted into a layout that can be saved and posted on Social Media platforms.

Inspirational quotes are driving great engagement on social platforms, so why not making your creation process easier?

This is a beta version and future features will include a filter to select specific topics. This will enable picking Quotes by topic from our database and the call to the photo api will be also customised by searching photos by corresponding tag.
Other features will include the possibility to export different image layouts and to customise fonts and colors.
